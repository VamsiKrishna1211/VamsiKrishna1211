## 🎓 Education:

Cultivating my knowledge at the convergence of circuits and code, I've earned a B.Tech in Electrical, Electronics, and Communication Engineering from GITAM University, Hyderabad.

## 🏗️ Projects that I've Poured My Heart Into:

- Age Prediction Server (I promise, it won't reveal your actual age 😉)
- Real-Time Noise Cancellation in Audio signals using Deep Learning (Because who doesn't love peace and quiet?)
- DIY drone (quadcopter) project (Because sometimes, you just have to build your own drone!)
