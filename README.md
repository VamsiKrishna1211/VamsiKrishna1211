# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Vamsi Krishna Kocherla

I'm a Senior Computer Vision Scientist by day, AI & Robotics enthusiast by night, and a caffeine-addict, straight-A do-er at all times! Oh, did I mention my unquenchable thirst for reading and understanding (and sometimes implementing) AI Research Papers? Well, there you have it!

Being an Electronics and Communication Engineer who happens to be a coding fanatic and an AI obsessive, I have managed to delve into the vast ocean of artificial intelligence. From developing super-complex multi-level detection and classification models to designing a microservice-based architecture for deploying the said models, I've got a bunch of tricks up my sleeves. But don't be fooled. I'm not just an AI machine. I also possess excellent communication skills, making me a charm to work with!

## ðŸŒ± What am I up to?

- Presently employed at Tata Consultancy Services as an AI/ML Developer and as a Sr. Computer Vision Scientist at Upjao Agrotech, where I'm tackling some pretty tough stuff on a daily basis (Trust me, it's not for the faint-hearted!). Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vamsi-krishna-kocherla-46941a16a/) for a deep dive into my experience and roles.

- Recently, I've been implementing AI-based automation of MLR review of promotional assets. This bad boy can extract, process, and verify data like it's a piece of cake.

- Also, I've been leading a project to extract and process Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Reports. Sounds tough, doesn't it? Well, I'm tougher!

- Developed multiple deep learning models, for everything from crop quality detection to accurate segmentation of small objects. My models are fast, accurate, and can run on anything from your grandma's smartphone to high-performance cloud-based systems.

- Implemented several CI/CD pipelines, designed multi-stage pipelines, and tinkered with various state-of-the-art models. In short, I've been having a blast.

- I've also been doing some cool stuff as a Computer Vision Intern at NCFlexE, IIT Kanpur.

## ðŸŽ“ Education
- Earned my B.Tech from GITAM University, Hyderabad, majoring in Electrical, Electronics and Communication Engineering.

## ðŸš€ Projects

- Age Prediction Server: A web server that accurately determines the age of a human face from an image. Yes, it's as awesome as it sounds!

- Real-Time Noise Cancellation in Audio signals using Deep Learning: This one's a lifesaver in a noisy city like mine!

- A cool DIY drone (quadcopter) project: Built
