## Summary
Well, hello there, Earthlings! I'm Vamsi Krishna, your friendly neighborhood Electrical, Electronics, and Communication Engineer, and self-proclaimed AI enthusiast hailing from the bustling city of Hyderabad, India. I've got this weird obsession with technology and its magical powers, so I decided to take a plunge into the mystical world of AI, ML, and Computer Vision. Currently, I'm playing the role of a Computer Vision Scientist at Upjao, where I spend my days (and nights) crafting ML models for a bunch of products and services.

## Skills
- Conjuring Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning magic
- Deep Learning (especially when it involves Computer Vision)
- Flying Drones (not into windows, I promise)
- Tinkering with Hardware (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESCs, Brushless Motors)
- And of course, Electronics and Communication Engineering (because why not?)

## I'm currently learning:
- Techniques for optimizing ML models for edge and mobile devices (because who doesn't love a challenge?)
- Advanced concepts in AI and Deep Learning (because there's always more to learn)
- New technologies and their practical applications (because staying updated is cool)

## How to reach me:
**LinkedIn:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)  
**Email:** [Email](mailto:vamsikmails@gmail.com)

## Recent Projects
- Identifying cattle using facial features and muzzle patterns at NCFlexE, IIT Kanpur (because cows need recognition too)
- Detecting age using human faces as input (no, it's not to guess your age at the carnival)
- A quadcopter with a flying range of 2.8 kilometers (because who needs roads when you can fly?)
- A line-following rover and a Bluetooth-controlled sports car (because why should humans have all the fun?)

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you want to discuss technology, projects, or collaboration. Remember, curiosity didn't kill the cat, it just made it smarter! Keep learning, folks!
